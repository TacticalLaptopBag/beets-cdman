# This is an example CD definition file
# You can create these yourself so you don't clutter your beets config,
# or if you want to only convert a few CDs at a time rather than all at once.

# The structure is simple, and exactly the same as the `cds` config field:
# cd-name:
#   - name: First Folder Name
#     query: "'album:Album Name'"
#   - name: Second Folder Name
#     query: "'other query' 'anded with first part of this query'"

ori:
  - name: Blind Forest
    query: "'album:Ori and the Blind Forest'"
  - name: Will of the Wisps
    query: "'album:Ori and the Will of the Wisps'"
portal:
  - name: Portal 2
    query: "'album:Portal 2'"
  - name: "Portal Stories: Mel" # Wrapped in quotes because of the colon
    query: "'album:Portal Stories Mel'"
