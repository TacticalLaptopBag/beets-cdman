# This is an example CD definition file
# You can create these yourself so you don't clutter your beets config,
# or if you want to only convert a few CDs at a time rather than all at once.

# The structure is simple, and exactly the same as the `cds` config field:
# cd-name:
#   type: mp3
#   folders:
#     - name: First Folder Name
#       query: "'album:Album Name'"
#     - name: Second Folder Name
#       query: "'other query' 'anded with first part of this query'"
# second-cd-name:
#   type: audio
#   track_queries:
#     - "'first tracks'"
#     - "'next tracks'"

ori:
  type: mp3
  folders:
    - name: Blind Forest
      query: "'album:Ori and the Blind Forest'"
    - name: Will of the Wisps
      query: "'album:Ori and the Will of the Wisps'"
discovery:
  type: audio
  track_queries:
    - "'artist:Daft Punk' 'album:Discovery'"
    - "'artist:Daft Punk' 'album:Daft Club' 'Aerodynamic'"
