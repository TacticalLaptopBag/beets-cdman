# This is an example CD definition file
# You can create these yourself so you don't clutter your beets config,
# or if you want to only convert a few CDs at a time rather than all at once.
# These files can be added to the `cd_files` config field.

# The structure is simple, and exactly the same as the `cds` config field:
ori:
  type: mp3
  bitrate: 192  # optional, defaults to your config
  folders:
    blind-forest:
      name: Blind Forest
      tracks:
        - query: "'album:Ori and the Blind Forest'"
    will-of-the-wisps:
      name: Will of the Wisps
      tracks:
        - query: "'album:Ori and the Will of the Wisps'"

discovery:
  type: audio
  populate_mode: copy  # optional, defaults to your config
  tracks:
    - query: "'artist:Daft Punk' 'album:Discovery'"
    - query: "'artist:Daft Punk' 'album:Daft Club' 'Aerodynamic'"
